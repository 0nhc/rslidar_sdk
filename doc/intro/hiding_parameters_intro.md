# Parameters Introduction

There is only one parameter file called config.yaml, which is locate in *rslidar_sdk/config/config.yaml*.  The whole file can be divided into two parts, the *common* part and *lidar* part. In multi-LiDARs case, the parameters in *common* part will be shred by all LiDARs, while the parameters in *lidar* part need to be adjust according to specific LiDAR.  

**The config.yaml is very strict to indentation! Please make sure the indentation is not changed when adjusting the parameters! **
